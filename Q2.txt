Step 1: Identify the Physical Volumes
First, ensure you have two physical volumes available for use. You can check them using the following command:


#sudo fdisk -l
This will list the available disks and partitions on your system. Identify the two physical volumes you want to use for creating the volume group.

Step 2: Create the Volume Group
We'll create a volume group named "my_vg" using the two identified physical volumes (replace /dev/sdX1 and /dev/sdY1 with the correct names of your physical volumes).


#sudo vgcreate my_vg /dev/sdX1 /dev/sdY1
Step 3: Create Logical Volumes
Now, we'll create three logical volumes within the "my_vg" volume group. Let's name them "data_lv," "scratch_lv," and "app_lv."


#sudo lvcreate -n data_lv -L 10G my_vg
#sudo lvcreate -n scratch_lv -L 20G my_vg
#sudo lvcreate -n app_lv -L 15G my_vg
This creates three logical volumes: data_lv with 10GB size, scratch_lv with 20GB size, and app_lv with 15GB size. You can adjust the sizes according to your requirements.

Step 4: Format the Logical Volumes with Ext4
Next, we'll format the logical volumes with the ext4 filesystem.


#sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/data_lv
#sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/scratch_lv
#sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/app_lv
Step 5: Mount the Logical Volumes
Now, we'll create mount points for the logical volumes and mount them at the specified paths.


#sudo mkdir /data /scratch /app
#sudo mount /dev/my_vg/data_lv /data
#sudo mount /dev/my_vg/scratch_lv /scratch
#sudo mount /dev/my_vg/app_lv /app
Step 6: Update /etc/fstab for Automatic Mounting (optional)
To make sure the logical volumes are automatically mounted upon system boot, add the following lines to the "/etc/fstab" file.


#/dev/my_vg/data_lv   /data   ext4   defaults   0   2
#/dev/my_vg/scratch_lv   /scratch   ext4   defaults   0   2
#/dev/my_vg/app_lv   /app   ext4   defaults   0   2
Step 7: Verify Mounting
You can verify that the logical volumes are mounted correctly by running:


#df -h
This will show you the mounted filesystems and their respective mount points.

That's it! You now have a volume group with three logical volumes mounted as /data, /scratch, and /app, each formatted with the ext4 filesystem.
